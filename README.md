This algorithm processes MODIS NDVI data within the Nyando catchment area from the Lake Victoria Basin in Google Earth Engine.
It calculates the median NDVI for each day of the year over the period 2019-2023, generates RGB visualizations for these median values, 
and creates a GIF animation to visualize the temporal NDVI changes within the specified region.
